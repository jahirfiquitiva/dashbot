DashBot
======

DashBot is a discord bot I created for my [dashboards support server](https://discordapp.com/invite/78h7xgj), it can handle a few commands and also reply when messages have some specific keywords.

### Commands

* `?version x`:

    Bot will reply with the latest version of x, x being either `Frames`, `Kuper` or `Blueprint`.
    If x isn't defined or doesn't match any of those 3, then it will reply with the latest version of all 3 dashboards.
    Alternative commands: `?versions x`, `?v x`
    
* `?update x`  

    Bot will reply with the how to update wiki link of x, x being either `Frames`, `Kuper` or `Blueprint`.
    If x isn't defined or doesn't match any of those 3, then it will reply with the latest version of all 3 dashboards.
    Alternative commands: `?updates x`, `?u x`

* `?setup`
    
    Bot will reply with some info regarding how to setup the dashboards, more specifically, links to their wikis and a link to [`dashbud.dev`](https://dashbud.dev).
    Alternative commands: `?bud`, `?dashbud`, `?config`

* `?wiki`
    
    Bot will reply with links to the dashboards wikis.
    Alternative commands: `?wikis`, `?w`

* `?donate`
    
    Bot will reply with some information regarding how to donate and support my work
    Alternative commands: `?support`, `?d`, `?s`

* `?help`
    
    Bot will reply with some information about the server and the commands it can run
    Alternative commands: `?what`, `?h`

### Keywords

Feel free to check out `filtered.json`. Basically, whenever the bot reads a message that includes any of the `keywords`, it will reply with the message in `response` joined by `\n`
